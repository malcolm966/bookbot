Create a new constant in constants.py to represent the player's turn speed. I named mine PLAYER_TURN_SPEED, and give it a value of 300.
Add a new rotate method to the Player class. It takes one argument: dt (I told you we'd use it!). When it's called, it should add PLAYER_TURN_SPEED * dt to the player's current rotation.
Paste in the following update method to the Player class:
    def update(self, dt):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

        if keys[pygame.K_a]:
            # ?
        if keys[pygame.K_d]:
            # ?

If you're using a non-QWERTY keyboard, you may want to change the keybindings in the code to something other than the W, A, S and D keys.

Update the missing lines to call the rotate method with the dt argument. To go left instead of right when a is pressed, you'll need to reverse dt... how can you do that...?
Hook the update method into the game loop by calling it on the player object each frame before rendering.
Run the game for at least a few seconds, and make sure the a and d keys rotate the player left and right, respectively
